Are you tangled in a web of JPEG files, unsure if they're just plain old JPEGs or if they're carrying the advanced JPEG Universal Metadata Box Format (JUMBF)? Look no further! JUMBF-Type-Checker is your ultimate tool, designed to peel back the layers of your files, revealing whether they house JUMBF and identifying the type of JUMBF embedded.

## 🔍 What's the Magic?

This nifty software is your go-to for distinguishing between a standard JPEG file and one enriched with JUMBF. It's perfect for those moments when you're decoder-less and curious about the secrets your files might hold.

## 🎯 Purpose

Our mission is simple yet powerful: to detect the presence of JPEG Universal Metadata Box Format (JUMBF - ISO/IEC 19566-5) in your files. The current version of our app excels in identifying JUMBF description types from various JPEG extensions, including:

- JPEG Privacy and Security (ISO/IEC 19566-4)
- JPEG 360 (ISO/IEC 19566-6)
- JPEG Snack (ISO/IEC 19566-8)

## 🛠 How to Dive In

1. **Launch the App**: Fire up the app in MATLAB (optimized for MATLAB R2022a or later).
2. **Upload and Go**: Hit the upload button, select your file, and let the magic begin.
3. **Analyze**: With your file loaded, press 'analyze' and watch as the app does its thing.
4. **Discover**: Post-analysis, marvel at the insights revealed about your file!
